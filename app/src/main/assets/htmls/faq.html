        <p><b>1. How does the app calculate the transcriptome size <br></b>
	In the app, the transcriptome size can be provided as an input in two ways - <br>
	a) As a custom input (in mb's) or <br> 
	b) As selected from the list of Eukaryotic organism's provided - The app takes the genome size of the organism and 
calculates the transcriptome size as its 10%.<br>
</p>
<p><b>2. What are the results based upon<br></b>
RNAtor was developed based on simulation RNA Sequencing experiments performed at 
different coverages, replicates and fold-change to depict the optimum coverage, 
required at a particular combination of fold-change and replicate, to detect maximum no of differentially expressed genes.
The manuscript for this experiment is provided in the reference section.
</p>
<p><b>3. What does fold-change indicate <br></b>
Fold change indicates the level at which the user is expecting to detect their differentially expressed gene's.
It is both the Normal/Tumor and the Tumor/Normal ration. Hence a fold-change of 3 indicates - 3,1/3.
<p><b>4. What does replicates indicate <br></b>
Replicates indicate the no of technical replicates the user can spare. The higher the no of replicates, the lower the depth
required. A minimum of 2 replicates are required.
<p><b>5. Can I export results as a document<br></b>
Yes ! the results can be mailed to the users email id by the send in mail option provided on the results page.
